## Introduction
The coursework is about gradient descent, where we chose a loss function and experimented to find the global minima.

## Part 1
Chose the Matya function that works with two variables.  

Matya Function looks like this:
f(x, y)=0.26(x^2+y^2) -0.48xy

With a global minimum at:
f(x*) = 0 at x*(0,0)
